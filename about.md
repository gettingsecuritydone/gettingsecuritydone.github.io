The Brass Tacks
===============

Getting Security Done (GSD) is information security consultancy that focuses on education/training, advising, mentoring, and providing program management responsibilities through such avenues as fractional CISO work, virtual CISO, and CISO coaching.

How did it all start and why?
-----------------------------

There is a crossroads in business where leaders know there is a need for security.  Simultaneously, security leaders need to know how to communicate with business leaders.  Crossing the chasm is often not easy.  It can be frustrating for executives who want to get things done, as well as for security professionals who want to keep out the bad guys.  Even though both groups are on the same team, sometimes it can feel like the agenda conflict is too great to make real progress.  Professionals on both sides feel stifled.  They talk past each other and too often dig in their heels without really appreciating or understanding the others’ perspective.

At least, that’s the way it seemed back when GSD was created.  Fortunately, there has been a lot of traction in the last decade to help bridge that gap.  There is still work to do, and this is the kind of work I find exciting, and that gap-bridging work is what I love.  I bring a wealth of experience as both a security leader \[give examples\], as well as deep appreciation and understanding of business priorities \[give examples:  mention MBA McCombs program?\]

I love helping companies succeed.  I love clearing roadblocks and facilitating the kind of communication that finds mutual respect and promises effective progress for companies in a way that also limits the risk.  But, let’s back up.  What exactly do we mean when we say, “risk?”

Defining our Terms
------------------

_Discuss “risk” here.  Consider the bald tire analogy.  I propose a video instead to keep the content page more navigable._

What other terms need defining?

What general problems does security address?

Why does it matter?

Must we speak in terms of negatives, or can we reframe it in positive terms? _Let Phil’s approach shine here._  Give examples.

I’d love to have a conversation.  I love to dig in and dive deep.  For those of you who know me, you know I love information exchange!  So, let’s get started!
