# As scams, malware, and online theft become larger and larger problems to businesses of all sizes and services, business and security leaders are needing better, faster, and stronger ways to secure the protection of their companies.

## What is information security?
Every website, online store, and business with an online connection are at risk, right now, of cyber attacks. Examples of these attacks include phishing emails and scams, credit card information compromise, and password attacks, among dozens of other threats. Information security--and its subcategory, cybersecurity--are forces designed against such threats, and specialists in these areas are trained to locate weaknesses in software and online security systems, as well as pressure-test updated and reworked systems.

## What is a vCISO, how does it work, and how would my company benefit from a vCISO?  

A vCISO (virtual Chief Information Security Officer) is a professional trained in the field of cybersecurity and information security and specializes in protecting online businesses, stores, and services from cyber attacks. To bring information security to a company effectively, the consultant and the leadership must work closely at first to ensure everyone is in agreement about what the risk tolerance is for the particular company at the particular time. Some may want an all-encompassing program while others may wish only to target particular key areas. Depending on the request of the client business, these specialists can create, improve upon, and/or test an effective cybersecurity plan, tailored to fit the needs and details of the company. These professionals are specifically trained to locate bugs or errors in the systems they work on, resulting in a strong and secure system.

Depending on the products and purpose of the business, some companies will need more advanced cybersecurity service than others. For most companies, having a mature security program is not as crucial as some make it out to be--although regardless, every company will benefit from security consulting. We advise speaking to an expert to get professional advice tailored to fit your business.

## Who are Getting Security Done and what do they bring to the cybersecurity table?

Getting Security Done, Inc. is a business dedicated to assisting and protecting companies with their online information security. Its founder, Phil Beyer, created the company in order to more closely connect with business leaders and build sustainable cybersecurity systems from the ground up, eliminating risks of loss exposure. Examples of the kind of loss exposure meant are hacking, ransomware, denial of service attack, defacement, data breach, data corruption, data loss, service outage, bad press, litigation (civil and/or criminal), governmental oversight, fines/penalties, intellectual property theft, loss of customer trust, and degraded customer experience. At its core, information security mitigates and prevents disruptions that can occur by a nefarious event.
