# As scams, malware, and online theft become larger and larger problems to businesses of all sizes and services, business and security leaders are needing better, faster, and stronger ways to secure the protection of their companies.

## What is information security?
Every website, online store, and business with an online connection are at risk, right now, of cyber attacks. Examples of these attacks include phishing emails and scams, credit card information compromise, and password attacks, among dozens of other threats. Information security--and its subcategory, cybersecurity--are forces designed against such threats, and specialists in these areas are trained to locate weaknesses in software and online security systems, as well as pressure-test updated and reworked systems.

## What is a vCISO and how would my company benefit from a vCISO?  
A vCISO (virtual Chief Information Security Officer) is a professional trained in the field of cybersecurity and informationa security and specializes in protecting online businesses, stores, and services from cyber attacks.

The textbook definition from NIST (spell this out) says, information security is “[t]he protection of information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability.”  https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/information_security

You may be thinking, “Of course I want to protect my company, my employees, and my customers, but why do I need a full-fledged security program to do that—or do I?"

Good question!  For many companies, having a mature security program really isn’t a do-or-die scenario.  Some people like to talk as if a company needs a security program to prevent complete failure.  There just isn’t a lot of evidence to support that level of dire concern.  

However, mitigating risk is a good reason for a mature and healthy security program.  What does“risk” mean?  Risk is “a function of the threats, assets, controls and impact factors (e.g., laws, etc.) that drive loss exposure.” [see https://www.fairinstitute.org/fair-risk-management].  See also https://youtu.be/uNvSSU6Toz4?si=PPUjHioNNurNiA6G.). Examples of the kind of loss exposure meant are hacking, ransomware, denial of service attack, defacement, data breach, data corruption, data loss, service outage, bad press, litigation (civil and/or criminal), governmental oversight, fines/penalties, intellectual property theft, loss of customer trust, degraded customer experience, to name a few.  At its core, information security mitigates and prevents disruptions that can occur by a nefarious event.

To bring information security to a company effectively, the consultant and the leadership must work closely at first to ensure everyone is in agreement about what the risk tolerance is for the particular company at the particular time.  Some may want an all-encompassing program while others may wish only to target particular key areas.  I have extensive experience with both full programs and with specific targeted areas.  Through dialog, I can identify key vulnerabilities and offer recommendations for addressing those vulnerabilities.  I have deep appreciation for a company’s desire to protect itself, but also to stay within often tight budgets.  Please see [this link, coming soon] for a full list of services I can provide.

This brings us to…who will guide your company in becoming secure?  I think I’m a swell guy, and lots (link) of others seem to agree.  Who am I?  Well, (bio paragraph with dashing photo) My philosophy is (brief statement).  My experience is (summary).  My particular strengths are (brief synopsis).  

We all know that no one can be all things to all people.  The most secure entity is one that is part of a collaborative whole, a community.  I would love to serve you!  If, however, you aren’t sure about our fit, I encourage you to also check out these stellar professionals who could benefit you.  I have many talented colleagues in the security community.
