The What, the Why and the How
                        …and the Who
====================================

Just what is information security?  
-----------------------------------

The textbook definition from NIST (spell this out) says, information security is “[t]he protection of information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability.”  https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/information_security

You may be thinking, “Of course I want to protect my company, my employees, and my customers, but why do I need a full-fledged security program to do that—or do I?"

Good question!  For many companies, having a mature security program really isn’t a do-or-die scenario.  Some people like to talk as if a company needs a security program to prevent complete failure.  There just isn’t a lot of evidence to support that level of dire concern.  

However, mitigating risk is a good reason for a mature and healthy security program.  What does“risk” mean?  Risk is “a function of the threats, assets, controls and impact factors (e.g., laws, etc.) that drive loss exposure.” [see https://www.fairinstitute.org/fair-risk-management].  See also https://youtu.be/uNvSSU6Toz4?si=PPUjHioNNurNiA6G.). Examples of the kind of loss exposure meant are hacking, ransomware, denial of service attack, defacement, data breach, data corruption, data loss, service outage, bad press, litigation (civil and/or criminal), governmental oversight, fines/penalties, intellectual property theft, loss of customer trust, degraded customer experience, to name a few.  At its core, information security mitigates and prevents disruptions that can occur by a nefarious event.

To bring information security to a company effectively, the consultant and the leadership must work closely at first to ensure everyone is in agreement about what the risk tolerance is for the particular company at the particular time.  Some may want an all-encompassing program while others may wish only to target particular key areas.  I have extensive experience with both full programs and with specific targeted areas.  Through dialog, I can identify key vulnerabilities and offer recommendations for addressing those vulnerabilities.  I have deep appreciation for a company’s desire to protect itself, but also to stay within often tight budgets.  Please see [this link, coming soon] for a full list of services I can provide.

This brings us to…who will guide your company in becoming secure?  I think I’m a swell guy, and lots (link) of others seem to agree.  Who am I?  Well, (bio paragraph with dashing photo) My philosophy is (brief statement).  My experience is (summary).  My particular strengths are (brief synopsis).  

We all know that no one can be all things to all people.  The most secure entity is one that is part of a collaborative whole, a community.  I would love to serve you!  If, however, you aren’t sure about our fit, I encourage you to also check out these stellar professionals who could benefit you.  I have many talented colleagues in the security community.
