Why significant?  What makes us different?  We believe we're awesome, and you are awesome, too.  We believe in bridges, abundance, collaboration.  cameras not roadblocks, plenty not scarcity, smiles not frowns.  Also, we really want money, and Phil always delivers way more than people expect.  Win-win.  A lot of this is tongue-in-cheek.  We should strive to be classy here.
